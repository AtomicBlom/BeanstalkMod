<h1><p id="Scripting System">Scripting System</p></h1>

The Minecraft Script Engine uses the JavaScript language.</br>You can write JavaScript scripts and bundle them with Behavior Packs to listen and respond to game events, get and modify data in components that entities have, and affect different parts of the game.</br><h1><p id="Demos">Demos</p></h1>

Here are some demos from your friends at Minecraft to help you get started with scripting. Simply unzip them to check out the code, or import them as a .mcpack to play with them</br><h2></h2>

<h1><p id="Getting Started">Getting Started</p></h1>

First you will need to download the latest Vanilla Behavior Pack. You can get this from the following link: https://aka.ms/behaviorpacktemplate </br>Once you have downloaded the Behavior Pack, unzip it to a folder. Inside the Behavior Pack you will find the scripts folder which contains all the scripting files you want to run.</br>In the scripts folder you will find two folders: one for client scripts and one for server scripts.</br>-Server Scripts: These scripts run on the server side of the game. This includes spawning new entities, adding components, or modifying components on an entity.</br>-Client Scripts: These scripts run on each individual player's side of the game. This is a good place to respond to events and manage anything specific to the player.</br>Once you have chosen whether you are making a client or server script, simply add a new blank text file with .js extension to the appropriate folder, and open it in your preferred code editor. Then code away! You can have as many or as few JavaScript files as you want here (the name of the files doesn't matter) and they will all be run independently of each other!</br></br> NOTE: For scripts to be run by the game, you need to enable Experimental Gameplay on the world where you will run scripts on. This will be necessary while scripting is still in beta.</br><h2>Folder Structure</h2>

<h1><p id="Structure of a Script">Structure of a Script</p></h1>

In this section you can find a quick description of the basic structure of a JavaScript script file for the Minecraft Script Engine. If you would like to learn more about JavaScript or want to follow a fundamentals tutorial, you can check the official documentation on the Mozilla Developer Network here: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript </br>These are, in a way, the required parts of a script but they are by no means the only parts you can have. You can create additional methods as needed - just make sure they are called from somewhere in one of the methods below!</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="1. System Registration">1. System Registration</p></h2>

First off we need to register the system for our file. This signs up our script to be set-up either on the client or server threads of the game. Generally speaking, you will choose based on whether you put the script file in the client or server folders. To do that simply call registerSystem on either the client or server and give it the version of the API you require.</br><h3>Parameters</h3>

<table border="1">
<tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
<tr>
<td>majorVersion</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>This is the major version of the Minecraft Script Engine your script was designed to work with</br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>minorVersion</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>This is the revision of the Minecraft Script Engine your script was designed to work with</br></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Code Examples:</h3>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="54" rows="2">
var sampleClientSystem = client.registerSystem(0, 0);
</textarea> </br>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="54" rows="2">
var sampleServerSystem = server.registerSystem(0, 0);
</textarea> </br>
<a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="2. System Initialization">2. System Initialization</p></h2>

This is the first method that gets called immediately after the system is registered. It will run as soon as the script loads at world start.</br>You can use this to set up the environment for your script: register custom components and events, sign up event listeners, etc. This will run BEFORE the world is ready and the player has been added to it, so you shouldn't try to spawn any entities here!</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="39" rows="4">
sampleSystem.initialize = function() {
	//Initialize all the things
};
</textarea> </br>
<a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="3. System Update">3. System Update</p></h2>

This method gets called once every game tick. The server aims to be 200 times per second, while client aims to be 60, but neither one is guaranteed and can vary with performance. This is a good place to get, check, and react to component changes.</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="35" rows="4">
sampleSystem.update = function() {
	//Update all the things
};
</textarea> </br>
<a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="4. System Shutdown">4. System Shutdown</p></h2>

This method gets called when the Minecraft Script Engine is shutting down. For the client this is when they leave the world; for the server this is after the last player has exited the world.</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="37" rows="4">
sampleSystem.shutdown = function() {
	//Cleanup all the things
};
</textarea> </br>

<br><br>

<h1><p id="Debugging">Debugging</p></h1>

Your script isn't working or doing what you want it to do? Fret not! We have built some debugging capabilities into the Script Engine to help you figure out what's going on with your script. If you are new to programming or want to learn more about debugging we suggest checking out the documentation about debugging with Visual Studio available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger </br></br>There are two ways to tell what happened when something goes wrong with a script: in-game and advanced, which we will describe below. You only need the game and your script to debug in-game, but you will need a Windows 10 PC and Visual Studio installed for the advanced debugging.</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="In-Game">In-Game</p></h2>

When you run a script in the game, the Script Engine will print out error messages whenever something goes wrong. For example, if you try to get a component that the script engine doesn't know about you will get an error.</br>To look at these messages you can open the chat screen which will have all the generated error messages there; or you can open the log file that the game generated. The location of the log file varies by platform. On Windows 10 you can find the log file in ' %APPDATA%\..\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\logs '</br>We strongly encourage you to build further debug messages and tools into your scripts while working on them. This will help you discern when something isn't working quite right. Reach out on the official Discord channel if you need additional help: https://discord.gg/Minecraft</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="Real-Time (Advanced)">Real-Time (Advanced)</p></h2>

If you have a Windows 10 PC with Visual Studio installed, you can attach the Visual Studio debugger and debug your script in real-time.</br>If you installed Visual Studio with the components mentioned in the "Recommended" section of this document you will have installed and enabled the Just-In-Time Debugger. This tool will pop-up a message from Visual Studio whenever an exception occurs in your script and allow you to open Visual Studio on the line of your script that broke.</br></br>Additionally, you can connect to the Script Engine manually and debug your code. You can use remote debugging to connect and debug Minecraft running on another device. Please refer to the Visual Studio Debugger documentation above for instructions on how to use remote debugging.</br>First you need to start up Visual Studio. If this is the first time you have launched Visual Studio after installation, we suggest setting up your environment for JavaScript development and logging in to your Microsoft account when prompted. This will set up the Visual Studio interface with the most important tools you will need.</br>Once you have Visual Studio open you should launch Minecraft. Then create a new world with Experimental Gameplay enabled and apply the Behavior Pack containing your scripts.</br>After creating the world go back to Visual Studio and click on the Debug menu. Then click on "Attach to Process". In the window that opens there will be a search box titled Filter Process. Click on it and type Minecraft.</br>Once the list is narrowed down to only the instance of Minecraft running, you can verify that the Script Engine is running by looking at the Type column. This will say Script and either x86 or x64.</br></br>Select the process and click on Attach to attach the debugger to the game. Now you will be able to press the Pause button to pause the Script Engine when the next line of script code runs. This allows you to inspect the values of variables in your script and break into Visual Studio if an error occurs in your code.</br>WARNING: When you hit a breakpoint to step through code with a debugger, it is possible for a client to time out and disconnect or for the server to disconnect all players.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h1><p id="Script Views">Script Views</p></h1>

Views are a way for you to filter for entities based on their components. Spatial views have an additional filtering system based on an area. Once you have registered a view, you can request all the entities that are captured by it. Views will only ever return entities that are currently active in the level. If your view extends into chunks that are not currently loaded, entities there will not be included in the view.</br><h2></h2>

<h1><p id="Script Components">Script Components</p></h1>

This is the documentation for the attributes, properties, and components available from the Minecraft Script Engine.</br>There are two kinds of components: server components and client components. We will go into a bit more detail on what they are in their respective sections below.</br>Components can be added, retrieved, updated, and removed from entities. They do not exist on their own. Currently only user-defined components can be added and removed from entities. A component must be in an entity in order to retrieve or update it.</br>Check the Script Engine Bindings section to see how to add, remove, retrieve, and update components. This section deals with the specific API of each component.</br><h1><p id="Client Components">Client Components</p></h1>

These components only run on the client where the script ran and can only be used from client scripts.</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="minecraft:molang">minecraft:molang</p></h2>

The MoLang component gives access to the MoLang variables in an entity. To learn more about MoLang varibles review the add-on documentation. In scripts, you can get and set these varibles that are defined in the entity's JSON files. Because of how the MoLang variables are formatted (entity.isgrazing for example) you must use the [] operator on the object to access the variable. The example below shows how to use the [] operator to access the variable.</br><h3>Code Example:</h3>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="73" rows="5">
var molangComponent = this.createComponent(entity, "minecraft:molang"); 
molangComponent["entity.molangexample"] = 1.0; 
this.needsUpdate(molangComponent); 

</textarea> </br>

<br><br>

<h1><p id="Server Components">Server Components</p></h1>

These are the components that run on the server and are synced with all the clients (players) in the world.</br>As much as possible, the API of each component matches its JSON counterpart (with some differences noted).</br><h2></h2>

<h2><p id="minecraft:attack">minecraft:attack</p></h2>

This component controls the Attack Damage attribute from the entity. It allows you to change the current minimum and maximum values. Once the changes are applied, the current attack of the entity will be reset to the minimum specified. With the minimum and maximum changed to the values specified. Any buffs or debuffs will be left intact.</br><h3>Parameters</h3>

<h1><p id="User-Defined Components">User-Defined Components</p></h1>

User-Defined components are a special kind of component that can be defined in script and no built-in game system acts on it.</br>The component needs to be registered with the Script Engine by giving it a name and a set of fields in the format name:value. Once applied, the component behaves like any of the built-in components: you can get it from an entity, modify its values, and apply the changes.</br>Currently User-Defined components are the only components that can be dynamically added and removed from an entity using scripts. They don't need to be previously defined in an entity's JSON file. In the current version these components will NOT be saved out or loaded back in: they only exist while the entity is there and need to be added back when reloading the level.</br><h2>Code Example:</h2>
<textarea readonly="true" cols="125" rows="2">
this.registerComponent("myNamespace:myComponent", { myString: "TamerJeison", myInt: 42, myFloat: 1.0, myArray: [1, 2, 3] });

The following Minecraft events are events the Script Engine is listening for and to which you can react in scripts.</br><h3></h3>

<h3><p id="minecraft:client_entered_world">minecraft:client_entered_world</p></h3>

This event is fired whenever a player joins the world. The event data contains the ID of the player in the world. The ID uniquely identifies the player in the world. This does NOT uniquely identify the player if they disconnect and reconnect.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h2><p id="Trigger-able Events">Trigger-able Events</p></h2>

The following Minecraft Events can be triggered from scripting and cause the game to respond accordingly.</br><h3></h3>

<h3><p id="minecraft:display_chat_event">minecraft:display_chat_event</p></h3>

This event is used to display a chat message to the specific player that is running the client script. The event data is the message to be displayed in plain text. Special formatting is supported the same way it would be if a player was sending the message.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h3><p id="minecraft:execute_command">minecraft:execute_command</p></h3>

This event is used to run a slash command from the specific player running the client script. The script runs it as that player. The event data contains the slash command in plain text. The slash command will be run immediately after the event is triggered.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h3><p id="minecraft:load_ui">minecraft:load_ui</p></h3>

This event is used to show a UI screen to the specific player running the client script. This event will add the UI screen to the top of the UI screen stack. The event data contains the file path to the screen's HTML file as a string. The screen will be shown immediately after the event is triggered. Only screens defined in a HTML file can be shown using this event.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h3><p id="minecraft:send_ui_event">minecraft:send_ui_event</p></h3>

This event is used to send UI events to the UI Engine for the specific player running the script. After the event is triggered, the UI event will be sent immediately.</br>Custom UI is based on HTML 5. Review the scripting demo for an example of a custom UI file.</br><h4>Parameters</h4>

<h3><p id="minecraft:spawn_particle_attached_entity">minecraft:spawn_particle_attached_entity</p></h3>

This event is used to create a particle effect that will follow an entity around. This particle effect is only visible to the specific player that is running the client script where you fired the event. Any effect defined in a JSON file (both in your resource pack and in Minecraft) can be used here. MoLang variables defined in the JSON of the effect can then be used to control that effect by changing them in the entity to which it is attached.</br><h4>Parameters</h4>

<h3><p id="minecraft:spawn_particle_in_world">minecraft:spawn_particle_in_world</p></h3>

This event is used to create a static particle effect in the world. This particle effect is only visible to the specific player that is running the client script where you fired the event. Any effect defined in a JSON file (both in your resource pack and in Minecraft) can be used here. Once the effect is spawned you won't be able to control it further. Unlike the server version of the event, the client version will spawn the particle in the dimension the player is currently in.</br><h4>Parameters</h4>
